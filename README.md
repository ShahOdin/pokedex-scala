# Pokedex-Scala

## Overview

Simple Rest API that proxies calls to two third party apis. Demonstrates the following aspects:

- Json serialisation and deserialization
- Error handling
- Http Server
- Http Client
- Modelling ADTs
- Testing
- code organisation

# Next steps

- Some tests are missing
- there is no docker file

The plan is to write a rust equivalent to compare the two in every aspect.
