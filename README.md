## Overview

Simple Rest API that proxies calls to two third party apis. Demonstrates the following aspects:

- Json serialisation and deserialization
- Business logic
- Error handling
- Http Server
- Http Client
- Modelling ADTs
- Testing
- code organisation

# Running the service

from the root directory simply run:

```bash
sbt run
```

# Next steps

- Some tests are missing
- there is no docker file
- the documentation about the endpoints is missing.

The plan is to write a rust equivalent to compare the two in every aspect.
